      <description>If you live in London, or have ever visited it, you have probably used an Oyster Card. Introduced in 2003 by Transport for London, your Oyster is a smart payment card which you can use to travel on public transport around London: on buses, tubes, trains, trams and boats, by loading up pay-as-you-go cash onto the card, or pay for a travel card.
If you register your card with TfL, you can view your journey history (however you can only go back as far as 6 weeks).</description>

      <description>About I&amp;rsquo;ve made this website to further a hobby, and I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to put up some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with data, visualisation, etc that I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting - mostly using the R programming language. It might not be interesting to anyone else at all, but I hope that others might be able to take something from here and further their own understanding.
I have no background in programming or data science - everything on here, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn myself and by following examples from the many, many excellent blogs and forums out there.</description>
