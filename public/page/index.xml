      <description>About I&amp;rsquo;ve made this website to further a hobby, and I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to put up some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with data, visualisation, etc that I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting - mostly using the R programming language. It might not be interesting to anyone else at all, but I hope that others might be able to take something from here and further their own understanding.
I have no background in programming or data science - everything on here, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn myself and by following examples from the many, many excellent blogs and forums out there.</description>
