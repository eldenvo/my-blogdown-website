      <description>If you live in London, or have ever visited it, you have probably used an Oyster Card. Introduced in 2003 by Transport for London, your Oyster is a smart payment card which you can use to travel on public transport around London: on buses, tubes, trains, trams and boats, by loading up pay-as-you-go cash onto the card, or pay for a travel card.
If you register your card with TfL, you can view your journey history (however you can only go back as far as 6 weeks).</description>
