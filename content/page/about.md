## About

I've made this website to further a hobby, and I'll use it to put up some things that I've been doing with data, visualisation, etc that I've found interesting - mostly using the R programming language. It might not be interesting to anyone else at all, but I hope that others might be able to take something from here and further their own understanding.

I have no background in programming or data science - everything on here, I've tried to learn myself and by following examples from the many, many excellent blogs and forums out there. I've been learning R and working with it for about a year, as I've always been obsessed with stats, numbers and maps.

I don't really know yet what I'll cover - things I'm interested include sports, politics, housing, transport, demographics, TV and literature.
